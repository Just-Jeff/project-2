            <h4>Characters</h4>
            <p>
                Characters in Genshin Impact are unlocked through a gacha based system. This involves the player spending in-game currency at a chance to roll for them in what are called "Banners", featuring rare loot and characters. Several characters and items are unlocked through the game’s natural progression and are given to you for free during special events. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These "Banners" feature several characters or items as the main highlight of an event, allowing the player to roll for them at an increased chance compared to the normal odds of unlocking them. In-game currency can be either gained through natural gameplay progression, or bought through the online store to roll for the characters and items you want. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Every 10 rolls you spend in a "Banner", you are gaurenteed a 4-star item or character, with a 5-star item or character being gaurenteed at 50 rolls. You can check the odds for specific items and characters under each "Banner" in the details section of that said "Banner". Please visit the main site to see a comprehensive list of all the game's characters and legendary items.
