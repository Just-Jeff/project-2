                    Genshin Impact is an open world action role-playing game that features the player controlling one of four interchangeable characters in a party. Switching between characters can be done quickly and during combat, allowing the player to use several different combinations of elemental skills and attacks at once. Characters may have their strengths enhanced in a variety of ways, such as their level, weapon, artifact, and skills they use allowing for combos against certain enemy types and synergy within their own party.
